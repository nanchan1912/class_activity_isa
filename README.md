1. We have used == which is the relational operator instead of = which is the assignment operator
2. *** Is used which makes no sense it's supposed to be either * or **. In this case because we are working with exponents, the operator should be **
3. There are two function name mismatches, one between name and calling. We have used is_narc to make the function but is_narcissistic to call the function
4. Similarly we have used print_narcis_numbers to define the function and print_narc_numbers to call it at the end
5. : is missing next to the if condition also and in the function definition also
6. It should be start, end in the function definition of print_narcissistic_numbers not (start end) because we need to pass two values

please consider my submission, I had to install GitHub app on my phone because I didn't bring my laptop to class
